# Clustering Evaluation Metrics

Internal Evaluation (No Ground Truth Required)

    Silhouette Score (Basic but reliable)
    Measures cohesion vs separation: higher is better (range -1 to 1).
    â†’ Good for general-purpose clustering.

    Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index (More sensitive than silhouette)
    Lower = better. Penalizes overlapping clusters.

    Calinskiâ€“Harabasz Index (Good for spherical clusters)
    Higher = better. Focuses on between- vs. within-cluster dispersion.

    Dunn Index (Less common, more theoretical)
    Higher = better. Favors well-separated, compact clusters.

    Density-Based Validation (Advanced, for DBSCAN/HDBSCAN)

        Cluster Validity Index (CVI)

        Relative Validity Index (RVI)

    Topic Coherence (Text-specific, advanced)
    Used in BERTopic, LDA. Measures semantic similarity among top words in topics.
    â†’ More aligned with human judgment of topic quality.

ðŸ”µ External Evaluation (If Ground Truth Available)

    Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
    Measures similarity between predicted and true clusters. Adjusts for chance.

    Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
    Measures mutual dependence between true/predicted labels. Scales 0â€“1.

    Fowlkesâ€“Mallows Index (FMI)
    Balance between precision and recall for clustering. 1 = perfect.

âœ… Best Practices

    Use Silhouette + Coherence for text.

    For BERTopic: topic_model.get_coherence() (e.g., c_v, u_mass).

    Visualize: Combine with UMAP/TSNE plots for intuitive insight.
